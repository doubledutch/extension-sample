# extension-sample

See the [DoubleDutch Developer Platform](https://doubledutch.github.io) website to get started
building your extension.

## Project

This sample extension contains two folders:

1. `mobile`
   React Native code for building the mobile attendee experience. Run `npm start` from this folder
   to start the React Native packager for your extension, and launch the
   [DoubleDutch Extension Simulator](https://github.com/doubledutch/simulator).
1. `web/admin`
   React web app that interfaces with the DoubleDutch CMS, for providing administrative
   functionality for your extension. Run `npm start` from this folder

## Publishing and Installing

Once your extension is developed, you can publish it to DoubleDutch to be added to event apps using
the [DoubleDutch CLI tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@doubledutch/cli).

See [Publishing and Installing Extensions](https://doubledutch.github.io/getting-started) for
details.
